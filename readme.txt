Display Top 100 movie quotes the same way as Hello Dolly does.

This plugin is based and in code pretty much the same with Hello Dolly plugin, and since I am movies freak, this is my paying homage to all those awesome movies.

The second functionality of this plugin: It hides Hello Dolly via CSS :)
